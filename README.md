# üìù Introduction

This project is an API for a donation and help request platform. It connects people in need with potential donors willing to offer support. Users can register as either recipients, who can create help requests for items such as food, clothing, or medicine, or as donors, who can view open requests and respond with offers to help.

The API is built with Typescript Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and it is designed to be secure, scalable, and easy to integrate with a front-end application or mobile app.
